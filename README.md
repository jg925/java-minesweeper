# Minesweeper Game built in Java
Author: Jinny Gui

A winter break 2020/2021 project that I started to relearn Java and implement a project that would help me practice JUnit 5 testing and well-written Java code. 

To avoid installing Eclipse, which I had used in a previous class [CS 2110 @ Cornell] on a different machine, I decided to use Gradle to run the tests. I referenced this [starter code](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5-samples/tree/main/junit5-jupiter-starter-gradle).

Environment: OpenJDK 11 LTS & OpenJ9
